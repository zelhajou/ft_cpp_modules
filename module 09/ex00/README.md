### **Leap Year** 🗓️  

A **leap year** is a year with **366 days** (instead of 365) to keep our calendar aligned with Earth’s orbit around the Sun. An extra day is added to **February (29 days)**.  

#### **Leap Year Rules:**  
A year is a leap year if:  
1️⃣ **Divisible by 4** → ✅ Possible leap year.  
2️⃣ **Divisible by 100** → ❌ Not a leap year (exception below).  
3️⃣ **Divisible by 400** → ✅ Leap year.  

#### **Why These Rules?**  
- Earth takes **365.2425 days** to orbit the Sun.  
- Adding **1 day every 4 years** corrects the 0.2425-day drift.  
- Skipping leap years every **100 years** prevents overcorrection.  
- Keeping leap years every **400 years** prevents undercorrection.  

#### **Examples:**  
✅ **Leap Years** → 1600, 2000, 2024  
❌ **Not Leap Years** → 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100  

This system keeps our calendar **accurate and synchronized** with the seasons! 🌍✨
